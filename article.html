                    <h2>Biden and his allies look past China on climate</h2>
                    <h6>
                        The president and European leaders are looking to countries like Indonesia, India and South Africa for climate change breakthroughs after failing to move Beijing at the G-20 summit.   
                    </h6>
                    <p>
                        GLASGOW, Scotland — President Joe Biden and his European allies are now working on Plan B to save his climate goals.
                        <br><br>
                        The Biden administration and European governments had been triangulating their climate strategy for months to push China, by far the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, to get in line with their plans to zero-out the planet-warming pollution. But that approach largely failed. China rejected that pressure at the G-20 summit in Rome, and its delegates came to Scotland showing little movement on climate.
                        <br><br>
                        President Xi Jinping didn’t even bother attending the Glasgow climate conference, and he won't be joining by video either. Biden chastised China, as well as Russia, in a press conference at the end of the G-20 meeting, saying the countries "basically didn’t show up in terms of any commitments to deal with climate change."
                        <br><br>
                        National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Air Force One en route to Glasgow that China was one of the “significant outliers … who will not be represented at the leader level at COP26 and who we do believe has an obligation to step up to greater ambition as we go forward. And we'll keep pressing on that.”
                        <br><br>
                        But he added: “There are other countries as well.”
                        <br><br>
                        As Beijing brushed aside U.S. overtures, Biden instead turned to Indonesian President Joko Widodo for his first bilateral meeting at the COP26 United Nations talks. Also in Widodo’s diary was U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
                        <br><br>
                        Indonesia contributes nowhere near the 27 percent of global emissions China's economy spews out. But it is still responsible for 2 percent of global greenhouse gases, and is one of the world's leading coal exporters. Experts say stopping climate change will be impossible without addressing the greenhouse gases produced by large countries like it with growing economies.
                        <br><br>
                        With little engagement from China, the U.S., EU and U.K. are pivoting to press Indonesia, India, South Africa, Mexico and Brazil to score potential climate victories — and hoping to reach their goal of keeping global temperatures within 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels. Above that mark, many disastrous climate changes get locked in, from rising sea levels to devastating storms and punishing droughts.
                        <br><br>
                        Biden and his climate envoy John Kerry have engaged in aggressive shuttle diplomacy with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose country is the planet's third largest carbon dioxide emitter. The two governments have worked on deals to bring public and private sector finance to help India reach Modi’s goal of deploying 450 gigawatts of renewable power by 2030 — equivalent to the capacity of more than 400 nuclear reactors.
                        <br><br>
                        Modi announced a new target of reaching net-zero emissions by 2070. He also announced goals for India to hugely increase its clean energy capacity before 2030 and lower its emissions intensity, a measure of the amount of greenhouse gases released per unit of economic activity.
